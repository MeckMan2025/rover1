MECKMAN DESIGN SYSTEM – VERSION 4.0

1. Brand Essence

The Meckman aesthetic represents precision framed through curiosity.
Every interaction should feel intentional, focused, and spatially grounded — like stepping into a small, illuminated chamber within a dark lab.

Keywords: Focus. Control. Discovery. Clarity in the dark.

2. Core Visual Theme
	•	Primary: Black (#000000) — endless space, clarity through contrast.
	•	Secondary: Charcoal (#2A2A2A) — structure and containment.
	•	Accents:
	•	Tan (#FFF2CC) — warmth, craftsmanship, and quiet refinement.
	•	Red (#CC0000) — curiosity spark; rare and deliberate.
	•	Text: White (#FFFFFF) and Light Gray (#CCCCCC) for hierarchy.

Usage Ratio: 70% Black / 20% Charcoal / 8% White & Gray / 2% Tan + Red.

3. Accent Application: The Curiosity Spark

The red accent is the signature of curiosity. It must be used sparingly to draw the user’s eye to a point of interest, interaction, or transition. Each major view or section should contain at most one primary red accent.

Types of Sparks:
	•	Heading Accent: A short, centered underline beneath a section title to introduce a key area (e.g., a video demo).
	•	Interactive Accent: A color change on hover for interactive elements like links, rewarding user exploration.
	•	Structural Accent: A single, centered dot (•) used within a divider to mark a transition between major page sections.
	•	Status Accent: Used to denote a special status, such as "In Progress" or "Current State," typically via text color or a border.

4. Layout & Structure
	•	The black background is the environment; content creates focal areas within it.
	•	Each layer (page → panel → modal) represents increased focus.
	•	Prioritize stacked, full-width content blocks over side-by-side layouts, especially if the content of the columns is imbalanced. This maintains a strong, centered vertical rhythm and avoids awkward empty space.
	•	Use consistent vertical spacing (24–32px for text, 80-120px for major sections).
	•	Avoid clutter, outlines, or gradients except to define intentional boundaries.

5. Modals, Panels, & Cards

Purpose: To focus user attention, eliminate noise, and create intentional moments of interaction. They are not interruptions — they are frames for clarity.

Design Principles:
	1.	Isolation by Darkness: Background dims to near-black (80–90% opacity).
	2.	Rounded Corners Always: All panels and modals have rounded corners (10–14px).
	3.	Minimal Shadows: Use subtle outer glows or light tan outlines instead of heavy shadows.
	4.	Contained Hierarchy: Each modal should express a single intent. No nested modals.

6. Components Summary

Component	Core Color	Behavior	Style
Card	Charcoal	Static	Rounded 8px, tan border
Panel	Charcoal	Slide or appear	Rounded 10px, thin tan border
Modal	Charcoal	Fade in	Rounded 12px, tan or red border
Button	Black / Tan	Hover invert	Rounded 6px
Input Field	Charcoal	Focus glow (tan)	Rounded 6px
Divider	Tan line at 20% opacity	—	Straight, centered spacing
Definition List	N/A	Static	Use for spec sheets. Two-column grid layout for clarity and alignment.

7. Tone & Copy

Every modal or panel should:
	•	Speak clearly and directly.
	•	Begin with an action word (“Connect Device,” “Enter Location,” “Track Motion”).
	•	End with a clear decision (“Go,” “Save,” “Start,” "Close").
	•	Avoid uncertainty — the user should always know what will happen next.

8. Environmental Accents

These are non-interactive, subtle background elements designed to add depth, texture, and thematic resonance to the experience. They should be discovered, not announced.

Types of Accents:
	•	Focal Frame: A large, geometric shape (e.g., circle, hollow rectangle) placed behind a key element like a hero image or video. It should be slightly offset and have a low opacity (e.g., 50%) to frame the content without competing with it.
	•	Schematic Pattern: A faint, repeating grid or line pattern applied to a section's background. It adds texture and reinforces the "precision engineering" aesthetic. Opacity should be very low (5-10%).
	•	Animated Guide: A dynamic element that responds to user interaction, such as a soft "pulse" of light that travels down a timeline on scroll. This makes static content feel more alive and guides the user's journey.

9. Brand Signature

Trait	Translation
Precision	Strict alignment; grid-based layouts for text and components.
Warmth	Tan borders and light touch of softness.
Curiosity	Single, deliberate red accent per view.
Focus	Use of modals, panels, and stacked layouts to guide the eye.
Calm	Static layouts, minimal motion, generous white space (black space).

Core Principle

“Every Meckman modal is a moment of clarity in a dark space.”

When you open one, the user should feel like the world goes quiet — and their task becomes obvious.
